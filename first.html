        <p>I've been playing basketball since I was 8 years old and now I'm on the Stuyvesant Varsity Basketball team. I'm looking forward to my last season of high school basketball and I hope you guys will come out and support us. As a fan, my favorite player has been Steph Curry since I was young but my favorite team has been the New York Knicks. I also believe the Knicks are now the best team in the Eastern Conference, yes the Knicks are better than the Celtics and we are making it to the finals next season. Jalen Brunson is better than Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown. As a teen I also enjoy playing video games in my free time. My favorite game at the moment is College Football 25 and I average about 4-5 hours a day on my Xbox. I used to be a huge sneakerhead, but now not so much.</p>
